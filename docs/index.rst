 Lagrangian Filtering
======================

**lagrangian-filtering** is a library for performing temporal
filtering of data in a Lagrangian frame of reference. The library is
written in Python, leveraging the flexible OceanParcels_ library for
efficient Lagrangian transformation offloaded to a just-in-time
compiled C kernel. The source code of this library can be found on
GitHub_.
