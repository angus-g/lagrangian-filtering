class LagrangeFilter(object):
    """The main class for a Lagrangian filtering workflow.

    The workflow is set up using the input files and the filtering
    parameters. Filtering can be performed all at once, or on
    individual time levels.

    Data must contain horizontal velocity components `U` and `V` to
    perform the Lagrangian frame transformation. Any variables that should
    be filtered must be specified in the `sample_variables` list (this
    includes velocity).

    Note:
        We use the OceanParcels convention for variable names. This means that
        ``U``, ``V``, ``lon``, ``lat``, ``time`` and ``depth`` are canonical
        names for properties required for particle advection. The mapping from
        the actual variable name in your data files to these canonical names
        is contained in the `variables` and `dimensions` dictionaries. When
        specifying `filenames` or `sample_variables`, the canonical names
        must be used, however any other variables may use whatever name you
        would like.

    Once the `LagrangeFilter` has been constructed, you may call it as
    a function to perform the filtering workflow. See :func:`~filter`
    for documentation.

    Example:
        A straightforward filtering workflow::

            f = LagrangeFilter(
                name, filenames, variables, dimensions, sample_variables,
            )
            f()

        Would result in a new file with the given `name` and an appropriate
        extension containing the filtered data for each of the `sample_variables`.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the workflow
        filenames (Dict[str, str]): A mapping from data variable names
            to the files containing the data.

            Filenames can contain globs if the data is spread across
            multiple files.
        variables_or_data (Union[Dict[str, str], xarray.Dataset]): Either
            a mapping from canonical variable names to the variable
            names in your data files, or an xarray Dataset containing
            the input data.
        dimensions (Dict[str, str]): A mapping from canonical dimension
            names to the dimension names in your data files.
        sample_variables ([str]): A list of variable names that should be sampled
            into the Lagrangian frame of reference and filtered.
        mesh (:obj:`str`, optional): The OceanParcels mesh type, either "flat"
            or "spherical". "flat" meshes are expected to have dimensions
            in metres, and "spherical" meshes in degrees.
        c_grid (:obj:`bool`, optional): Whether to interpolate velocity
            components on an Arakawa C grid (defaults to no).
        indices (:obj:`Dict[str, [int]]`, optional): An optional dictionary
            specifying the indices to which a certain dimension should
            be restricted.
        uneven_window (:obj:`bool`, optional): Whether to allow different
            lengths for the forward and backward advection phases.
        window_size (:obj:`float`, optional): The nominal length of the both
            the forward and backward advection windows, in seconds. A
            longer window may better capture the low-frequency signal to be
            removed.
        highpass_frequency (:obj:`float`, optional): The 3dB cutoff frequency
            for filtering, below which spectral components will be
            attenuated. This should be an angular frequency, in [rad/s].
        advection_dt (:obj:`datetime.timedelta`, optional): The timestep
            to use for advection. May need to be adjusted depending on the
            resolution/frequency of your data.

        This is main method of the filtering workflow. The timesteps
        to filter may either be specified manually, or determined from
        the window size and the timesteps within the input files. In
        this latter case, only timesteps that have the full window
        size on either side are selected.

        Note:

                window are selected.

                existing output file with the same name as this
                experiment. Default behaviour will not clobber an
                existing output file.

                as relative to the first timestep in the input dataset
